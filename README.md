This is an app to keep track of some of your favorite TV shows.

The data for this app is obtained through a REST api, and right now the data has been hosted as a static JSON file at manoharprabhu.github.io/SoapSync/showlist_gson.json

The project uses Picassa library for async downloads of the images, and GSON library for marshalling and unmarshalling json.
